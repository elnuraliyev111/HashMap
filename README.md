# HashMap

HASH MAPS: PYTHON
Review
Now that we have all of the functionality of a Hash Map, it’s time to review what we’ve learned!

Instructions
1.
Create a hash map hash_map. Give it an array size over 15.

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
Assign the following key-value pairs to hash_map:

Key: 'gabbro', Value: 'igneous'
Key: 'sandstone', Value: 'sedimentary'
Key: 'gneiss', Value: 'metamorphic'
Checkpoint 3 Passed
3.
Retrieve the value from each of the three keys from hash_map. Print them out!

Checkpoint 4 Passed

Congratulations! You implemented a fully-functional hash map! Some things to consider:

How would you delete a key-value pair from this hash map?
Parts of the code are a little repetitive, how would you factor these roles differently?
What should your hash map do if a key-value is added and the array is full? How does this hash map handle that?
